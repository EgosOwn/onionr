# About

Onionr is a decentralized, peer-to-peer communication and storage network, designed to be anonymous and resistant to (meta)data analysis, spam, and corruption.

Onionr stores data in independent packages referred to as 'blocks'. The blocks are synced to all other nodes in the network. Blocks and user IDs cannot be easily proven to have been created by a particular user. Even if there is enough evidence to believe that a specific user created a block, nodes still operate behind Tor or I2P and as such cannot be trivially unmasked.

Users are identified by ed25519/curve25519 public keys, which can be used to sign blocks or send encrypted data.

Onionr can be used for mail, as a social network, instant messenger, file sharing software, or for encrypted group discussion.

The whitepaper (subject to change prior to alpha release) is available [here](docs/whitepaper.md).

## Main Features

* [X] üåê Fully p2p/decentralized, no trackers or other single points of failure
* [X] üîí End to end encryption of user data
* [X] üì¢ Optional non-encrypted blocks, useful for blog posts or public file sharing
* [X] üíª Easy API for integration to websites
* [X] üïµÔ∏è Metadata analysis resistance and anonymity
* [X] üì° Transport agnosticism (no internet required)

**Onionr API and functionality is subject to non-backwards compatible change during pre-alpha development**

# Documentation

More docs coming soon.

* [Block specification](docs/specs/block-spec.md)
* [HTTP API](docs/http-api.md)

# Install and Run on Linux

The following applies to Ubuntu Bionic. Other distros may have different package or command names.

`$ sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev tor`

* Have python3.6+, python3-pip, Tor (daemon, not browser) installed (python3-dev recommended)
* Clone the git repo: `$ git clone https://gitlab.com/beardog/onionr`
* cd into install direction: `$ cd onionr/`
* Install the Python dependencies ([virtualenv strongly recommended](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/)): `$ pip3 install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt`

(--require-hashes is intended to prevent exploitation via compromise of PyPi/CA certificates)
