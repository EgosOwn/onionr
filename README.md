# Summary

Onionr is a decentralized, peer-to-peer data storage network, designed to be anonymous and resistant to (meta)data analysis and spam/disruption.

Onionr stores data in independent packages referred to as 'blocks'. The blocks are synced to all other nodes in the network. Blocks and user IDs cannot be easily proven to have been created by particular nodes (only inferred). Even if there is enough evidence to believe a particular node created a block, nodes still operate behind Tor or I2P and as such are not trivially known to be at a particular IP address.

Users are identified by ed25519 public keys, which can be used to sign blocks or send encrypted data.

Onionr can be used for mail, as a social network, instant messenger, file sharing software, or for encrypted group discussion.

## Main Features

* [X] Fully p2p/decentralized, no trackers or other single points of failure
* [X] End to end encryption of user data
* [X] Optional non-encrypted blocks, useful for blog posts or public file sharing
* [X] Easy API system for integration to websites
* [X] Metadata analysis resistance
* [X] Transport agnosticism (no internet required)

**Onionr API and functionality is subject to non-backwards compatible change during pre-alpha development**

# Install and Run on Linux

The following applies to Ubuntu Bionic. Other distros may have different package or command names.
