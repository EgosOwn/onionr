Onionr ("Onion Relay") is a decentralized/distributed peer-to-peer communication network, designed to be anonymous and resistant to (meta)data analysis, spam, and corruption.

Onionr stores data in independent packages referred to as 'blocks'. The blocks are distributed to all interested nodes. Blocks and user IDs cannot be easily proven to have been created by a particular user. Even if there is enough evidence to believe that a specific user created a block, nodes still operate behind Tor and as such cannot be trivially unmasked. Anonymity is achieved by a stateless network, with no given indication of what node a block originates from. Through message mixing and key privacy, it is intended to be nigh impossible to discover the identity of a message creator or recipient.

Via long-term traffic analysis, a well funded adversary may discover the most probable node(s) to be creating a set of related blocks, however doing so would only lead them to a node behind Tor. As the first node that a block appears on is almost always not the creator of the block, there is plausible deniability regarding the true creator of the block.

Onionr gives the individual the ability to speak freely, without fear of surveillance and censorship.

Users are identified by ed25519/curve25519 public keys, which can be used to sign blocks or send encrypted data.

Onionr can be used for mail, as a social network, instant messenger, file sharing software, or for encrypted group discussion.

The whitepaper is available [here](docs/whitepaper.md).

Encrypted, metadata-masking mail application. One of the first distributed mail systems to have basic forward secrecy.

# Documentation

More docs coming soon.

* [Block specification](docs/dev/specs/block-spec.md)
* [HTTP API](docs/dev/http-api.md)

# Install and Run on Linux

The following applies to Ubuntu Bionic. Other distributions may have different package or command names.

Master may be unstable, you should use the latest release tag. (checkout via git: `$ git checkout release-latest`)

`$ sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev tor`

* Have python3.7+, python3-pip, Tor (daemon, not browser) installed. python3-dev is recommended.
* Clone the git repo: `$ git clone https://gitlab.com/beardog/onionr --tags`
* cd into install direction: `$ cd onionr/`
* Install the Python dependencies ([virtualenv strongly recommended](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/)): `$ pip3 install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt`
* (Optional): Install desktop notification dependencies: `$ pip3 install --require-hashes -r requirements-notifications.txt`

(--require-hashes is intended to prevent exploitation via compromise of PyPi/CA certificates)

## Run Onionr

* Run Onionr normally:  `$ ./onionr.sh start`
* Run Onionr in background as daemon: `$ ./start-daemon.sh`
* Open Onionr web interface  `$ ./onionr.sh openhome`
* Gracefully stop Onionr from CLI `$ ./onionr.sh stop`

# Security

Onionr is alpha software. This means it is unstable, probably insecure, and experimental.

No matter how good Onionr and other software gets, there will always be ways for clever or well-funded adversaries to break your security.

Onionr does not protect your identity if you associate your user ID with your name either on Onionr or elsewhere.

*Do not rely on Onionr or any other software to hold up if your life or liberty are at stake.*
