# About

Onionr is a decentralized, peer-to-peer communication network, designed to be anonymous and resistant to (meta)data analysis, spam, and corruption.

Onionr stores data in independent packages referred to as 'blocks'. The blocks are synced to all other nodes in the network. Blocks and user IDs cannot be easily proven to have been created by a particular user. Even if there is enough evidence to believe that a specific user created a block, nodes still operate behind Tor or I2P and as such cannot be trivially unmasked.

Users are identified by ed25519/curve25519 public keys, which can be used to sign blocks or send encrypted data.

Onionr can be used for mail, as a social network, instant messenger, file sharing software, or for encrypted group discussion.

The whitepaper (subject to change prior to alpha release) is available [here](docs/whitepaper.md).

## Main Features

* [X] üåê Fully p2p/decentralized, no trackers or other single points of failure
* [X] üîí End to end encryption of user data
* [X] üì¢ Optional non-encrypted blocks, useful for blog posts or public file sharing
* [X] üíª Easy HTTP API for integration to websites
* [X] üïµÔ∏è Metadata analysis resistance and anonymity
* [X] üì° Transport agnosticism (no internet required)

Onionr ships with various application plugins ready for use out of the box:

Currently usable:

* Mail
* Public anonymous chat/message board
* Simple webpage hosting - Will be greatly extended
* File sharing (Work in progress)

Not yet usable:

* Instant messaging

**Onionr API and functionality is subject to non-backwards compatible change during pre-alpha development**

Encrypted, metadata-masking mail application. One of the first distributed mail systems to have basic forward secrecy.

# Documentation

More docs coming soon.

* [Block specification](docs/specs/block-spec.md)
* [HTTP API](docs/http-api.md)

# Install and Run on Linux

The following applies to Ubuntu Bionic. Other distros may have different package or command names.

`$ sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev tor`

* Have python3.6+, python3-pip, Tor (daemon, not browser) installed. python3-dev is recommended.
* Clone the git repo: `$ git clone https://gitlab.com/beardog/onionr`
* cd into install direction: `$ cd onionr/`
* Install the Python dependencies ([virtualenv strongly recommended](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/)): `$ pip3 install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt`

(--require-hashes is intended to prevent exploitation via compromise of PyPi/CA certificates)

## Run Onionr

* Run Onionr normally:  `$ ./onionr.sh start`
* Run Onionr in background as daemon: `$ ./start-daemon.sh`
* Open Onionr web interface  `$ ./onionr.sh openhome`

# Security

Onionr is pre-alpha. This means it is unstable, probably insecure, and experimental.

No matter how good Onionr and other software gets, there will always be ways for clever or well-funded adversaries to break your security.

Onionr does not protect your identity if you associate your user ID with your name either on Onionr or elsewhere.

*Do not rely on Onionr or any other software to hold up if your life or liberty are at stake.*
