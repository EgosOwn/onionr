# Contributing to Onionr

One of the great things about open source projects is that they allow for anyone to contribute to the project.

This file serves to provide guidelines on how to successfully contribute to Onionr.

## Code of Conduct

Contributors in project-related spaces/contexts are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/beardog108/onionr/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
