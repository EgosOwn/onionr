To use OnionrMail, open the web interface:

`$ onionr.sh openweb`

Navigate to the mail interface from the navbar.

## Receiving mail

Copy your ID from the textbox below the navbar. Publish the ID so that someone (or general people) know your ID to send messages to it. Note that associating the ID with your real ID publicly removes anonymity.

## Sending mail

1. optionally add the recipient as a friend via the friends page.
2. click compose in the mail menu
3. either select the recipient from the friend list or paste their ID in manually into the recipient box
4. send away!
