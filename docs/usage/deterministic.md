# Deterministic address

Deterministic addresses are simply Onionr user IDs that are generated from a passphrase rather than general entropy.

To generate an Onionr deterministic, create a random passphrase of at least 25 characters of length. **It is very important that your passphrase is highly random. 9+ words is recommended for your passphrase**

`$ onionr add-id true`
