# Introduction

The most important thing in the modern world is information. The ability to communicate freely with others. The internet has provided humanity with the ability to spread information globally, but there are many people who try (and sometimes succeed) to stifle the flow of information.

Internet censorship comes in many forms, state censorship, corporate consoldiation of media, threats of violence, network exploitation (e.g. denial of service attacks).

To prevent censorship or loss of information, these measures must be in place:

* Resistence to censorship of underlying infrastructure or hosts

* Inability to violently coerce human(s) behind the information (ex. law enforcement or personal threats "doxxing")
    
    * To reduce metadata to a minimum, a system should anonymize its users by default

* Economic availability. A system should not rely on a single device to be constantly online, and should not be overtly expensive to use. The majority of people in the world own cell phones, but comparatively few own personal computers, particuarly in developing countries.


# Issues With Existing Software

There are many great projects that tackle decentralization and privacy issues, but there are none which tackle all of the above issues.
